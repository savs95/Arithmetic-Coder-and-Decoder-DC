###Arithmetic Encoder and Decoder
- Both files (decimal_2_binary.py and arithmetic_coding.py) need to be in the same directory
- To encode any content put it in a file content.txt
- The encoder function returns the encoded content and also prints the compression ration
- The decoder function decodes the content passed by the encoder
