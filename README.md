###Arithmetic Encoder and Decoder
- Both files (decimal_2_binary.py and arithmetic_coding.py) need to be in the same directory
- To encode any content put it in a file content.txt
- The encoder function returns the encoded content and also prints the compression ration
- The decoder function decodes the content passed by the encoder
- The last line of the arithmatic_coding.py prints the decoded message
- Usage (note: content.txt file must be present in the same directory) 
```
-$ python arithmetic_coding.py
```
